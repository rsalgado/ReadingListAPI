## Reading List API

This is the tutorial project made after CodeSchool's screencasts for the [Surviving APIs with Rails](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/surviving-apis-with-rails) course. It is a REST API for basic management of reading lists and books, built using Rails 4.2, following the screencasts [Soup to Bits: Surviving APIs with Rails](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-surviving-apis-with-rails) and [Soup to Bits: Exploring Rails 4.2](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-exploring-rails-4-2).
